### How I come up with an estimated cost of $20,000

Below is the list of changes and reasons for the solution:

- `Changed`: Added more EC2 instances and load balancer.
    - **Reason**: This will provide high availability for the application. Even if `Northern Virginia` region is completely down, application will be up and running in `Oregon` region.
- `Changed`: Added RDS database instance in `Oregon` region.
    - **Reason**: This will reduce the latency for users accessing application in other region. Because data can be fetched from `Oregon` region read replica RDS database instance.
- `Changed`: Scaled up RDS database instances.
    - **Reason**: This will improve the database performance and will be more effecting in case of huge traffic on application platform.
